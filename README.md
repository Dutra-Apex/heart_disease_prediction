# Heart disease prediction
This repository will utilize the UCI heart disease dataset to predict the likelihood of heart diseases based on health parameters.
It contains the data of 303 patients, and the target variable is to determine wether the patient lived or died. This is useful to determine what conditions can be lethal.
