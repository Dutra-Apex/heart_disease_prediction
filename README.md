# Heart disease prediction
This repository will utilize the UCI heart disease dataset to predict the likelihood of heart diseases based on health parameters.
It contains the data of 303 patients, and the target variable is to determine wether the patient lived or died. This is useful to determine what conditions can be lethal.

The notebook will perform data exloration as well as apply different machine learnig algorithms, such as K-means, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression.

General overview of the attributes.

1) age

2) sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)

3) cp - chest pain type (4 values)

4) trestbps - resting blood pressure

5) chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6) fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

7) restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8) thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

9) exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10) oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11) slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

12) ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13) thal - 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.

14) target - (1 = died; 0 = lived)
